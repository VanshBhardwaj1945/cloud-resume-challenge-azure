      <h2>Summary of Qualifications</h2>
      <p>
        My journey into technology began with a curiosity about how systems work and how they can be protected, which led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Texas State University.
        After experience as a software engineer in cloud environments, I moved toward security and resilient systems. I am focused on DevSecOps and cloud security roles where I can help teams design and deliver safer applications while continuing to develop as a security-minded engineer.
