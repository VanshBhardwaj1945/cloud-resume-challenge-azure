# Security Policy

## Purpose
This project is a cloud-based portfolio application built for learning, demonstration, and defensive security research purposes. It is not intended for production use or real-world deployment without additional security hardening and review.

## Responsible Disclosure
If you discover a security vulnerability related to this project, please report it responsibly.

Contact:
- Email: Scorpio.vansh@gmail.com  
- LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/vanshbhardwaj1945  

I will review and acknowledge reports as quickly as possible.

## Scope
This project demonstrates:
- Cloud infrastructure design and automation
- Serverless backend development
- Secure CI/CD deployment workflows
- Basic telemetry and monitoring validation

Testing was performed only in controlled development and personal cloud environments that I own or have authorization to use.

## Security Considerations Demonstrated
This project attempts to apply secure engineering principles including:
- Identity and access separation using cloud IAM and service principals
- Backend logic isolation behind API layers
- HTTPS and secure edge routing
- Automated deployment validation via CI/CD pipelines

## Limitations
This project is not a production security implementation and may not include:
- Advanced threat monitoring
- Production-grade secret management
- Enterprise-scale hardening configurations

## Ethical Use
Do not attempt to replicate security testing or configuration changes against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## Future Improvements
Planned improvements include:
- Enhanced monitoring and detection logging
- Additional authentication and authorization controls
- Expanded infrastructure hardening validation
